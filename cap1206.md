## Porting linux to cap1206

When i looked in the kernel for cheap cap sensors i chose the cap1106 but it was replaced with the 1206 the port was pretty simple as I only had to change the diffs the datasheet said. The only big problem was submitting it to the maintainers.

To submit code to the kernel it has to go through a review process and has to pass an automated inspection. i ran ./scripts/checkpatch.pl and when it passed i sent it using `git send email`
i did however have to add it to the `/documentation` folder so when i did that i re submitted. the maintainer accepted it, added it to his branch and i waited. Funnily enough the kernel was changing from `.txt` format to `.yaml` format and my commit had a conflict, but the merger fixed it and it got through!!!

I did have to test the code so when the chips arrived I designed a board to test them on when that eventually also came I used the RPI to test it because that was the easiest way to do so. After i tested i submitted of corse.
